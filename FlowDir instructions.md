FlowDir is a MATLAB tool for forecasting the travel directions of effusive volcanic hazards (lava flows and block and ash flows). This is meant as a quick start guide, for more information and an understanding of how FlowDir works please refer to Tennant et al., (...).

###Getting started

1. Download and unpack the zipfile into your MATLAB folder ensuring that the paths are set correctly. The folder contains all files needed to run FlowDir along with several case studies. Contents of the folder should be as follows: 

```
FlowDir
   ├── Code
   |	 ├── FlowDir.m
   ├── DEMs
   |	 ├── Merapi.tif
   ├── Dependancies
   |	 ├── topotoolbox-master
   |	 ├──	invprctile.m
   └── Out
         └── Merapi
```

2. Type `FlowDir`into the MATLAB command window and the following GUI will pop up
